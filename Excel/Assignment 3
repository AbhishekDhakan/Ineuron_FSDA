Q1. How and when to use the AutoSum command in excel ?

Ans ->

The AutoSum feature in Excel is a very useful and convenient tool that simplifies the task of adding up values in a column or row. 
It's akin to having an automatic calculator that does the addition for you. Understanding how and when to utilize AutoSum can 
significantly enhance your data analysis activities.

let us see how to implement it Step-by-step:
1. Cell Selection: To employ AutoSum, start by selecting the cell where you want the sum to be displayed. This is usually the cell directly beneath a column of 
   numbers or to the right of a row of numbers that you wish to add up.
2. Activate AutoSum: Press the AutoSum button located on the Excel Ribbon in the "Editing" group or use the keyboard shortcut Alt + Equals (=). 
   Excel will automatically try to determine the range of cells to add based on the surrounding data.
3. Modify Range (if necessary): If Excel's guess is not accurate, you can modify the range by dragging to select the required cells or by manually entering the range.
4. Confirm with Enter: After you've chosen the range, press Enter to finalize the AutoSum calculation. Excel will immediately 
   compute the sum of the selected range and show the result in the chosen cell.

When to Utilize AutoSum at right time:
- Adding Columns: Use AutoSum to swiftly compute the total of values in a column, such as sales data or expenses.
- Adding Rows: Similarly, use AutoSum to calculate totals across rows, like monthly expenditures or sales by region.
- Verifying Totals: AutoSum can also be employed to check totals calculated by hand, ensuring precision and efficiency in your computations.
- Refreshing Totals: When you insert or delete data in a column or row, AutoSum automatically refreshes the total, sparing you the time and effort of recalculating.
