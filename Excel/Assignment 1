Q1. What do you mean by cells in an excel sheet ?

Ans ->

In Excel, cells are the tiny rectangular compartments you observe when you launch a spreadsheet. Each cell possesses its own distinct address, similar to a residence
on a lane. This address is a fusion of a letter for the column and a digit for the row, such as A1, B2, and so forth. Consider cells as receptacles where you can place diverse types of
data, like numerals, words, or even formulas that carry out computations. They are akin to the sections in a storage cabinet where you sort your items. 
Cells facilitate you to neatly sort and manipulate data, simplifying the task of dealing with large volumes of information in a structured manner.

3. Organization: Cells assist in organizing information in a spreadsheet, simplifying its readability and usability.
4. Manipulation: You can execute various operations on cells, like inputting data, modifying content, or applying formulas to compute results.
