Q2. How can you restrict someone from copying a cell from your worksheet ?

Ans ->

Excel provides various settings and features that can be used to prevent a cell in your worksheet from being copied. One such method involves protecting the worksheet and defining

actions, such as copying cells, by setting a password to deter unauthorized alterations. By implementing these strategies, you can retain control over your Excel 
worksheet's data and stop others from copying particular cells without your consent.
