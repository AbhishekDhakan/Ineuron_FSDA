    "Q1. What is a Macro? How is it useful in excel or in your daily work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "A macro is a pre-recorded set of operations that can be triggered with a single instruction. It's essentially a tool for automating repetitive tasks by capturing a sequence of keystrokes, mouse actions, and commands, which can be replayed as needed. Macros are beneficial in Excel and routine work because they streamline workflows and automate tasks that would otherwise need manual input, saving time and effort. For instance, a macro can be designed to format data, produce reports, or carry out calculations at the click of a button, minimizing the time dedicated to monotonous tasks and boosting productivity. Furthermore, macros can be tailored to meet specific needs, enabling users to customize automation solutions according to their unique requirements and preferences. In summary, macros are potent instruments that simplify intricate tasks and boost efficiency in Excel and other routine work procedures."
