    "Q8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing logging messages is frequently deemed superior to using print() for a variety of reasons:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Output Control**: Logging offers you greater control over where the messages are dispatched (e.g., console, file, network), the structure of the messages, and the severity level of each message. This adaptability enables you to customize the logging behavior to meet your specific requirements.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Logging Levels**: Logging introduces different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), permitting you to classify and prioritize messages based on their significance. This allows you to filter messages according to their severity, simplifying the process of concentrating on critical issues.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Centralized Configuration**: Logging facilitates the configuration of the logging behavior in a centralized fashion, making it straightforward to alter the logging settings globally without modifying the code. This is particularly beneficial for enabling or disabling logging, adjusting the logging level, or altering the output destination.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Library Compatibility**: Numerous libraries and frameworks utilize logging for emitting messages, so employing logging in your code ensures consistency and interoperability with these libraries. It also enables you to incorporate your code seamlessly into larger projects or systems that extensively use logging.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Performance**: Logging is generally more efficient than print() for emitting messages, especially in production environments with substantial volumes of data. Logging can be optimized for performance and scalability, rendering it suitable for use in high-performance applications.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In summary, the use of logging messages offers enhanced flexibility, control, and compatibility compared to using print(), establishing it as the preferred choice for logging and debugging in Python applications."

    "Q9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in a debugger are utilized for distinct types of program execution control during the debugging process:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Step Over**: Upon clicking the Step Over button, the debugger runs the current line of code and proceeds to the subsequent line. If the current line encompasses a function call, the debugger runs the entire function call and advances to the next line in the current context. It does not delve into the function call to debug its internal code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Step In**: Pressing the Step In button directs the debugger to delve into the function or method call on the current line of code. If the current line encompasses a function call, the debugger enters the function and halts at the first line of code within that function, enabling you to debug its internal code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Step Out**: The Step Out button is employed to run the remaining lines of code within the current function or method call and return to the caller. If you are currently debugging within a function or method, pressing Step Out will run all the remaining lines of code within that function or method and return to the line of code that invoked it, effectively stepping out of the current function call.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In summary, Step Over runs the current line and advances to the next line without delving into function calls, Step In delves into the internal code of a function or method call for debugging, and Step Out runs the remaining code within the current function or method call and returns to the caller. These buttons offer granular control over program execution during debugging, aiding developers in tracing and analyzing code execution flow effectively."

    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "A breakpoint is a specific location in a program's source code where the debugger will temporarily halt the execution of the program. When the program hits a breakpoint during debugging, it ceases execution, enabling you to examine the state of the program, variables, and control flow at that particular point in the code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Breakpoints are beneficial for debugging as they permit you to selectively interrupt execution at crucial points in your code, such as prior to a significant function call or at the commencement of a loop iteration. This allows you to scrutinize the behavior of the program, verify the values of variables, and effectively diagnose issues.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Breakpoints can be interactively set and removed within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or debuggers, typically by clicking on the code editor's margin or by employing keyboard shortcuts. They can also be conditional, implying that they will only interrupt execution if a certain condition is fulfilled.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In essence, breakpoints are a fundamental instrument in the debugging process, offering developers detailed control over program execution and aiding in the detection and resolution of bugs and issues in their code."
