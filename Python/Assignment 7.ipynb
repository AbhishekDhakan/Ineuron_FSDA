    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re` module in Python is responsible for creating Regex (regular expression) objects.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- `re` module: This module offers functionalities for handling regular expressions in Python. It encompasses functions and methods for formulating, compiling, and utilizing regular expressions to search, match, and modify text strings.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For instance:\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "import re\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+')  # Compile a regular expression pattern\r\n",
    "matches = pattern.findall('There are 123 apples and 456 oranges.')  # Find all matches of digits in the string\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By using the `re` module, you can formulate Regex objects by compiling regular expression patterns, which can subsequently be used to execute various operations such as searching, matching, and replacing text based on the established pattern."

    "Q2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw strings (`r''`) are frequently used in Regex objects in Python as they prevent backslashes (`\\`) from being interpreted as escape characters.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In regular expressions, backslashes are typically used to escape special characters and denote metacharacters or special sequences. However, in Python string literals, backslashes also serve as escape characters for special sequences such as newline (`\\n`) or tab (`\\t`).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Utilizing raw strings (`r''`) in Regex objects ensures that backslashes are treated as literal characters, simplifying the writing and reading of regular expressions by eliminating the need for double escaping. This is particularly beneficial when working with complex regular expressions that contain numerous backslashes, as it prevents confusion and reduces the chance of errors.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For instance:\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "import re\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Without raw string\r\n",
    "pattern = re.compile('\\\\d+')  # Compiles a regular expression to match digits\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# With raw string\r\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+')  # Compiles the same regular expression using a raw string\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Employing a raw string (`r''`) in regular expressions enhances the expression's simplicity and readability by eliminating the need for extra escaping of backslashes."
