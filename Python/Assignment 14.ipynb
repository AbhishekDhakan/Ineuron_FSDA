    "Q1. What does RGBA stand for ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "RGBA is an acronym for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This is a color scheme utilized in digital graphics to depict colors on digital devices such as computer monitors. The RGBA scheme enhances the RGB model by incorporating an extra channel known as Alpha, which indicates the color's transparency or opacity.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the RGBA model, each element (Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha) is denoted by an integer value that varies from 0 to 255. Here, 0 signifies no intensity, and 255 signifies maximum intensity. By mixing different intensities for the Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha channels, a vast array of colors and levels of transparency can be created."

    "To extract the RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) value from any image using Python's Pillow library, the `getpixel()` function can be utilized. This function provides the RGBA value for a particular pixel in the image.\r\n",

    "# Load the image file\r\n",

    "Q3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "A box tuple, also known as a bounding box tuple, signifies a rectangular area within an image. It is usually expressed as a tuple with four integer values `(left, top, right, bottom)`, where:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- `left`: The x-coordinate of the rectangle's left boundary.\r\n",
    "- `top`: The y-coordinate of the rectangle's upper boundary.\r\n",
    "- `right`: The x-coordinate of the rectangle's right boundary.\r\n",
    "- `bottom`: The y-coordinate of the rectangle's lower boundary.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The box tuple outlines the spatial boundaries of the rectangular area within the image. It can be employed to designate areas of interest, cropping regions, or bounding boxes for objects in the image.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For instance, in the context of Python's Pillow library, a box tuple can be used as an argument to various methods like `crop()` to define the region of the image to be cropped, or `paste()` to determine the location where another image or element should be pasted onto the original image.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Here's a demonstration of how a box tuple operates in Pillow:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "from PIL import Image\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Load an image file\r\n",
    "img = Image.open('example.jpg')\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Establish a box tuple indicating a region to be cropped (left, top, right, bottom)\r\n",
    "bbox = (100, 50, 300, 250)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Crop the image using the box tuple\r\n",
    "cropped_img = img.crop(bbox)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Show or save the cropped image\r\n",
    "cropped_img.show()\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this code, the box tuple `(100, 50, 300, 250)` designates a rectangular area within the image to be cropped, with the left boundary at x-coordinate 100, upper boundary at y-coordinate 50, right boundary at x-coordinate 300, and lower boundary at y-coordinate 250. The `crop()` function then uses this box tuple to crop the image accordingly."
