    "Q1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "Escape characters in Python are special characters that are prefixed with a backslash (`\\`). They are used to denote characters that are either challenging to type or reserved for specific functions. These characters enable you to incorporate characters in strings that would otherwise be interpreted differently, such as newline characters, tab characters, or quotation marks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Here are some frequently used escape characters:\r\n",
    "- `\\n`: Denotes a newline character, which causes the subsequent text to begin on a new line.\r\n",
    "- `\\t`: Denotes a tab character, which causes the subsequent text to be indented.\r\n",
    "- `\\'` or `\\\"`: Denotes single or double quotation marks, respectively, allowing you to incorporate quotation marks within a string without ending it.\r\n",
    "- `\\\\`: Denotes a backslash character itself, allowing you to incorporate a backslash in a string.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For instance, to create a string with a newline character, you would use `\\n` as follows:\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "print(\"Hello\\nWorld\")\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "This would produce:\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "Hello\r\n",
    "World\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Likewise, to incorporate a tab character, you would use `\\t`:\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "print(\"Name:\\tJohn\")\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "Output:\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "Name:   John\r\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",

    "```python\r\n",

    "Q4. The string \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not escaped a problem ?\n",

    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the single quote character within the string \"Howl's Moving Castle\" is not an issue because the string is wrapped in double quotes `\" \"`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Python permits strings to be wrapped in either single quotes `' '` or double quotes `\" \"`. When a string is wrapped in one type of quote, any instances of the other type of quote within the string are treated as literal characters and do not require escaping.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For instance:\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "print(\"Howl's Moving Castle\")  # Enclosed in double quotes\r\n",
    "print('Howl\\'s Moving Castle')  # Escaping single quote within single quotes\r\n",

    "```\r\n",
    "Howl's Moving Castle\r\n",
    "```\r\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a string with newlines without employing the `\\n` escape character, you can utilize triple quotes `''' '''` or `\"\"\" \"\"\"` to formulate a multiline string.\r\n",

    "                    string\"\"\"\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
