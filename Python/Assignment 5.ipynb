    "\n",
    "An empty dictionary in Python is denoted by `{}` with no key-value pairs inside. It's represented as a pair of curly braces with nothing between them. For instance, `{}` signifies an empty dictionary. This notation indicates that the dictionary has no key-value pairs. Dictionaries in Python are mutable and can be modified by adding or removing key-value pairs after creation."

    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a dictionary entry that has `'foo'` as the key and `42` as the value is denoted as `{'foo': 42}`. This representation indicates a dictionary containing a single key-value pair, where `'foo'` is the key and `42` is its corresponding value. Python dictionaries utilize key-value pairs for data storage and retrieval, with the key acting as a unique identifier for retrieving its associated value. Here, the key `'foo'` is linked to the value `42`."

    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference between a dictionary and a list in Python is the manner in which they store and structure data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A dictionary is a set of key-value pairs, with each key being unique and linked to a particular value. This structure enables efficient value retrieval based on their corresponding keys. Dictionaries are unordered collections, which means there is no guaranteed order of the key-value pairs.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Conversely, a list is a collection of elements arranged in a specific order, with each element indexed by its position within the list. Lists facilitate sequential access to elements via their indices. Unlike dictionaries, lists use integer indices starting from 0 and preserve the sequence in which elements were added.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In essence, the key difference is that dictionaries employ keys for value access, providing quick lookup times but lacking inherent order, while lists use integer indices for element access and preserve the sequence of elements."

    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to access `spam['foo']` when `spam` is defined as `{'bar': 100}`, Python will throw a `KeyError`. This error is triggered because the key `'foo'` is not present in the `spam` dictionary. In Python, dictionaries use keys to correspond to their respective values, and trying to access a non-existent key in the dictionary leads to a `KeyError`. In this case, since `spam` only has the key `'bar'`, trying to access `'foo'` will result in an error as this key is not available in the dictionary."

    "A more concise way to achieve the same functionality as the given code snippet is to use the `setdefault()` method of dictionaries.

Hence, the more succinct version of the provided code is:\r\n",

    "Q8. How do you \"pretty print\" dictionary values using which module and function ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "To display dictionary values in Python in a more readable format, often referred to as \"pretty printing\", you can utilize the `pprint()` function from the `pprint` module. This module is designed to present data structures like dictionaries in a format that's easier to read, especially when they include nested or complex data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use it:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "import pprint\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Example dictionary\r\n",
    "my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "# Pretty print the dictionary\r\n",
    "pprint.pprint(my_dict)\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The `pprint()` function will enhance the visual presentation of the dictionary `my_dict`, making it more readable, particularly for dictionaries with nested structures or extensive lists of key-value pairs. This can be beneficial for debugging or presenting data in a format that's easier for humans to read."
