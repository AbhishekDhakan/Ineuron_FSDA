    "Q1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree() ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "To differentiate between `shutil.copy()` and `shutil.copytree()` in Python's shutil module, it's crucial to comprehend their unique functionalities.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "`shutil.copy()` is utilized to duplicate a single file from one place to another. It requires two parameters: the source file path and the destination file path. This function generates a new file in the destination location, maintaining the contents of the source file.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Conversely, `shutil.copytree()` is employed to recursively duplicate an entire directory tree from one place to another. It also requires two parameters: the source directory path and the destination directory path. This function generates a new directory (if it doesn't already exist) and duplicates all files and subdirectories from the source directory to the destination directory.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Grasping the distinction between these functions is vital for executing file operations precisely and efficiently in Python programs."

    "Q2. What function is used to rename files ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides renaming files, the `os.rename()` function can also be utilized to relocate files within the file system by supplying a new path as the second argument. This adaptability makes it a potent tool for file management tasks. However, it's crucial to remember that `os.rename()` functions at the file system level and might not operate across distinct file systems or partitions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Moreover, `os.rename()` can be subject to permissions constraints, particularly in environments where users possess limited access rights. Hence, it's vital to ensure that the current user possesses the necessary permissions to rename or relocate the file.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "It's noteworthy that if you're executing complex file operations involving multiple files or directories, you might consider using higher-level functions offered by libraries like `shutil` for more sturdy and efficient handling.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In conclusion, comprehending how to effectively use `os.rename()` enables developers to dynamically manage file names and locations, facilitating smoother file manipulation operations within Python programs."

    "Q3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary distinction between the delete functions in the `send2trash` and `shutil` modules is rooted in their actions and objectives.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The `send2trash` module offers a secure method to erase files and directories by relocating them to the operating system's trash or recycle bin, as opposed to permanently erasing them. Its `send2trash.send2trash()` function accepts a file or directory path as a parameter and shifts it to the trash, providing a safeguard in case the deletion was unintended.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Conversely, the `shutil` module provides the `shutil.rmtree()` function to recursively erase a directory tree, encompassing all files and subdirectories within it. This function irrevocably erases the specified directory and its contents from the file system.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Comprehending the differences between these delete functions is vital for safely and effectively managing file deletion operations within Python programs."

    "Q4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "The method in ZipFile objects that corresponds to the open() method in File objects is the `ZipFile()` constructor. Just as the open() method is employed to open files for reading or writing, the ZipFile() constructor is utilized to instantiate a new ZipFile object, granting access to the contents of a ZIP archive. This constructor accepts the path to the ZIP file and an optional mode argument, which designates the mode in which the archive should be opened (for instance, 'r' for reading or 'w' for writing). Grasping this method is crucial for efficiently handling ZIP archives in Python."
