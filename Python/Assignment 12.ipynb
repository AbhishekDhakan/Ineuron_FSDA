    "Q1. In what modes should the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() File objects will be opened ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PdfFileReader()` and `PdfFileWriter()` objects from the PyPDF2 library in Python do not necessitate explicit file objects to be opened with modes like standard file operations.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When employing PyPDF2 to read or write PDF files, you typically open the PDF file in binary mode (`'rb'` for reading and `'wb'` for writing) using the built-in `open()` function. Subsequently, you pass the opened file object to the `PdfFileReader()` or `PdfFileWriter()` constructor.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For instance, when reading a PDF file:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "import PyPDF2\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:\r\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\r\n",
    "    # Additional code to read from the PDF file...\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "And when writing to a PDF file:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "import PyPDF2\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "with open('output.pdf', 'wb') as pdf_output:\r\n",
    "    pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()\r\n",
    "    # Additional code to write to the PDF file...\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In both scenarios, the file is opened with the suitable mode (`'rb'` for reading and `'wb'` for writing) outside of the `PdfFileReader()` and `PdfFileWriter()` objects. These objects do not interact directly with the file system or perform file operations, but rather operate on file-like objects provided to them."

    "Q2. From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5 ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a Page object for page 5 from a PdfFileReader object in PyPDF2, you can employ the `getPage()` method, supplying the index of the desired page (0-based index). Here's an illustration of how it can be done:\r\n",

    "    page_5 = pdf_reader.getPage(4)\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this instance, `pdf_reader.getPage(4)` fetches the Page object for page 5 of the PDF (bear in mind, indexing commences from 0, so page 5 corresponds to index 4). You can then utilize `page_5` to carry out additional operations on that specific page, such as extracting text or altering its content."
