    "Q1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are beneficial in programming for a variety of reasons:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Modularity:** Functions enable you to decompose your program into smaller, manageable, and reusable chunks of code. Each function is designed to carry out a specific task, which simplifies the understanding, testing, and maintenance of your code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Code Reusability:** Once a function is defined, it can be utilized multiple times throughout your program without the need to rewrite the same code. This encourages code reuse and minimizes duplication, thereby making your code more efficient and maintainable.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Abstraction:** Functions offer a degree of abstraction by concealing the implementation details of a specific task behind a well-defined interface. This allows you to concentrate on the high-level logic of your program without being concerned about the intricate details of how each task is executed.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Organization:** Functions aid in organizing your code by grouping related functionalities together. This enhances readability and makes it easier to navigate and comprehend the structure of your program.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Encapsulation:** Functions encapsulate functionality, implying that they can possess their own local variables and parameters. This helps avoid naming conflicts and unintended side effects, as variables defined within a function are typically only accessible within that function's scope.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Testing and Debugging:** Functions simplify the testing and debugging of your code. Since functions execute specific tasks, you can isolate and test them individually, making it easier to detect and rectify errors when they arise.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In conclusion, functions are a crucial component of programming that aid in improving code organization, promoting code reuse, and making programs easier to comprehend, maintain, and debug."

    "Q2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "The code within a function is executed when the function is invoked, not when it's defined.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When you define a function, you are essentially setting up a plan for a specific task or set of tasks to be carried out. The actual execution of the code within the function takes place only when the function is invoked in another part of the program.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For instance, consider the following function definition:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "def my_function():\r\n",
    "    print(\"This code is executed when the function is invoked\")\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this scenario, the code inside the function (`print(\"This code is executed when the function is invoked\")`) will not be executed until you invoke the function `my_function()` in another part of your program:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "my_function()  # This is where the code inside the function is actually executed\r\n",
    "```\r\n",

    "- `def` is the keyword that signifies the beginning of a function definition.\r\n",
    "- `function_name` is the identifier of the function you're defining.\r\n",
    "- `parameters` (optional) are variables that you can pass into the function to modify its behavior.\r\n",
    "- The colon (`:`) denotes the end of the function definition header and the commencement of the function body.\r\n",
    "- The function body is the section where you write the code that carries out the desired tasks.\r\n",
    "- Optionally, you can incorporate a `return` statement to specify the value that the function sould return.\r\n",

    "\n",
    "The primary distinction between a function and a function call is their respective roles and actions within a program:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Function:**\r\n",
    "   - A function is a segment of reusable code that carries out a particular task or a group of tasks.\r\n",

    "   - Functions act as plans or templates for tasks that can be performed multiple times within a program.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Function Call:**\r\n",
    "   - A function call is the act of invoking or executing a function to carry out its defined task(s).\r\n",
    "   - It requires specifying the function's name along with any necessary arguments or parameters, and executing the function to run its block of code.\r\n",
    "   - When a function is called, the program temporarily halts its current execution, runs the function's block of code, and then resumes execution from where it was inteconclusion, a function is a defined segment of code that encapsulates a specific task, while a function call is the act of invoking that function to execute its code and complete its task(s) within the program."

    "Q5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Python program, there is usually a single global scope and potentially numerous local scopes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Global Scope:**\r\n",
    "   - A Python program typically has only one global scope.\r\n",
    "   - The global scope encompasses variables, functions, and other objects that are defined at the program's top level or within a module.\r\n",
    "   - Variables declared in the global scope can be accessed from any part of the program.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Local Scopes:**\r\n",
    "   - Local scopes are established each time a function is invoked.\r\n",
    "   - Every function call generates its own local scope.\r\n",
    "   - Variables declared within a function are scoped to that function and can only be accessed within that function's scope.\r\n",
    "   - Once the function returns, its local scope is discarded, and the variables within it no longSo \r\n",
    "Therefore, while there is usually only one global scope, the quantity of local scopes in a Python program can fluctuate based on the number of function calls and the nesting of function definitions within the program."

    "- **Variables become unreachable:** Any variables that are defined within the function are only reachable while the function is executing. Once the function call concludes, you can't access those variables anymore.\r\n",

    "Q7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans ->\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the notion of a return value pertains to the value that a function delivers back to the code that invoked it. When a function is invoked, it carries out its task and may optionally yield a result. This result, or value, is then returned to the caller using the `return` statement.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Indeed, it is feasible to have a return value in an expression. In Python, you can employ a function call, including one with a `return` statement, within an expression just as you would use any other value. For instance, consider the following code:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "def add(a, b):\r\n",
    "    return a + b\r\n",

    "print(result)  # Output: 8\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this code, the `add()` function is invoked with arguments `3` and `5`. It computes the sum of the two arguments and returns the result (`8`). This returned value is then assigned to the variable `result`. So, `result` now holds the value returned by the `add()` function, and you can use `result` as part of an expression."
