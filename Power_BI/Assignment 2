   enforcing access controls, encryption, and other measures to keep your information safe and sound.
5. Metadata Maestro - Every bit of information about your Power BI content like data lineage and report connections is
   meticulously managed by the Back End cluster. This "metadata magic" enables data governance and smooth collaboration among users.
6. Scalability - As your data needs grow, the Back End cluster can adapt. It scales horizontally, adding more processing
   power to handle increasing workloads and user demands, ensuring smooth and efficient performance.

Q4. What ASP.NET component does in Power BI Service Architecture ?

Ans ->

In Power bi the one displaying your reports, dashboards, and data in all its glory goes to ASP.NET Think of it as the engine that makes the Power bi
experience smooth and seamless.

There are some imp ASP.NET points such as :-
a. Data Visualization Magician : ASP.NET brings your data to life! It crafts all those eye-catching charts, graphs,
   and data tables you see in Power BI, making insights instantly accessible.
b. Security Sentinel : Remember logging in with your username and password ASP.NET is the security guard! It verifies 
   your identity and grants access only to what you're authorized to see, keeping your data safe and secure.
c. Back End Liaison : ASP.NET acts as the messenger between you and the data powerhouse behind the scenes. When you request a 
   report or refresh data, ASP.NET retrieves the information and delivers it directly to you.
d. Customization Champion : Companies sometimes want to add their own flair or connect Power BI with other tools. 
   ASP.NET empowers developers to build custom web apps or integrate features, making Power BI truly adaptable.
